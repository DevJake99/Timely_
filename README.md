## About the Project

This project allows the user to log text into a text box, which will then save to local storage. The text will be displayed even after the page is refreshed or 
revisisted. 
## Getting Started

To use this application, copy the provided URL into any browser and begin typing in the text boxes. This app can be used to organize your day 
based off a 9-5 work schedule. The different colors will indicate whether that hour is present, past or future.
